# The BumpBot is a way for individuals to meet new people and find new friend groups while still staying socially distant. The BumpBot will take information that you give to it, and use this information to create voice and text channels with people that you are likely to be compatible with. As freshmen at UT Austin, this issue affects our team personally, so our inspiration comes from the desire to help others in similar positions to our own. In order to implement this technology, we combined the capabilities of a discord bot with the Glide app to better organize user information, and Google Cloud technology. While still in a prototype stage, the end goal is to provide this accessory to applications outside of Discord and improve the algorithms and information taken to provide more accurate matches over a larger range of people.
